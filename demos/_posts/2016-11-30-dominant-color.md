Lately I have been very interested in taking a photo with my Raspberry Pi and getting the dominant colour to use as the colour of my Hue LED strip at home.

The first step was to get the dominant colour from a photo and I found the excellent [color-thief](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/) and [color thief on github](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief/).

As a start I have used an image and once the image and page have loaded the background will change to the dominant color of the photo.
